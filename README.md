The evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized healthcare by enabling efficient information retrieval and patient support. However, linguistic underrepresentation hinders progress for low-resource languages like Sindhi. To address this gap, we introduce SindMediTex, a 1st and largest Sindhi medical text dataset comprising 100,000 entries categorized into four classes: Condition, Treatment, Prevention, and Other. We introduce a novel dataset SindMediTex is designed to facilitate robust NLP model development for healthcare-focused applications in Sindhi. The dataset incorporates real-world variability and intentional noise to simulate challenges in medical text classification. With categories representing medical conditions, treatments, prevention strategies, and general health information, this dataset is poised to enable more efficient information retrieval and patient support. 
The dataset was synthetically generated and manually curated by native Sindhi speakers and healthcare professionals to ensure linguistic and contextual accuracy. The labels were reviewed to maintain consistency and relevance. The dataset is stored in CSV format, with two columns: Text (Sindhi medical text) and Label (category). By introducing SindMediTex, we aim to bridge the gap in Sindhi NLP resources, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes for the millions of people who speak this language.

The SindMediTex dataset was developed using a multi-step approach. First, a team of native Sindhi speakers and healthcare professionals collaborated to create a comprehensive list of medical terms and concepts. Next, a data generation script was used to create a large corpus of Sindhi medical text. The text was then manually annotated and categorized into four classes: Condition, Treatment, Prevention, and Other. The dataset was reviewed and validated to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The SindMediTex dataset consists of 100,000 labeled entries, divided equally among four categories: Condition, Treatment, Prevention, and Other. Each entry includes a Sindhi medical text and its corresponding label. The dataset is stored in CSV format, with two columns: Text and Label. The dataset includes a range of medical topics, including diseases, symptoms, treatments, and prevention strategies. The text is written in a clear and concise manner, making it suitable for NLP applications.
